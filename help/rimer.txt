Rimer - timer

Rimer can run multiple timers simultaneously

It accepts the following commands:
- <start> main server (requires callback)
- <add> new timer (requires name and duration)
- <pause/resume/halt> timer (requires name)
- <quit> main server
- <report> explained down here

It can get timer reports. Timer report is a snapshot of all currently running timers in the following format:

name1 elapsed_time total_duration status callback_arg
name2 elapsed_time total_duration status callback_arg

See <CALLBACK> for status and callback_arg explanations
